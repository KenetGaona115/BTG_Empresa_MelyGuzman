        Throughout the brainstorming, 2 products emerged, which were the commercialization of crepes and frappés
        or desserts, for which we put the products to the vote through the survey carried out, in which they resulted
        obtaining the same percentage of assent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, we decided to sell crepes and frappés, as it was the most
        possible for our organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day prior to the first marketing at the school, our team met at the home of a
        of the members to carry out the different products that we would offer to improve the flavors,
        consistency, textures, this has been somewhat difficult since certain relatives gave some possibilities that
        They made us modify the mixture for the crepes and the flavor of the frappés. After 5 attempts at the end
        We managed to have quite delicious mix and frappes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the commercialization there were certain problems, because we only had 30 minutes to sell
        and the crepes took some time to cook and we had several consumers to attend to. Despite the
        situations has been really good for us, since we culminated everything that we brought and we have received good
        comments on the taste of our own products, for which we were happy and finally it was worth the
        sorry for the income we got.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were so tired that the next day 2 members of our team did not attend, since Carol had
        blisters on both feet from standing for a long time and Samantha's right arm hurt quite a bit, both
        what
        I couldn't even move it. However, the marketing experience was worth it, since we had fun
        much
        and we were left with many triumphs of making the 3 foreign sales that we needed to finish the
        purpose.
